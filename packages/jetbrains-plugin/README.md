# VersionLens Redux for JetBrains IDEs

The JetBrains plugin starts the shared `versionlens-lsp` server through the IntelliJ Platform LSP API.

## Package

- Plugin id: `com.versionlens.jetbrains`
- Display name: `VersionLens Redux`
- Build file: [`build.gradle.kts`](build.gradle.kts)
- Runtime server: `crates/versionlens-lsp`

The plugin is written in Kotlin and targets IntelliJ IDEA through the IntelliJ Platform Gradle plugin.

## Build the language server

From the repository root:

```bash
cargo build -p versionlens-lsp
```

The packaged plugin builds and embeds a release version of the server. The plugin resolves the server in this order:

1. `versionlens.lsp.path` Java system property.
2. `VERSIONLENS_LSP` environment variable.
3. Bundled release binary extracted to the IDE system directory.
4. Repository-local debug binary at `target/debug/versionlens-lsp`.
5. `versionlens-lsp` on `PATH`.

## Build the plugin

```bash
gradle -p packages/jetbrains-plugin buildPlugin --no-daemon
```

The built plugin artifact is written under `packages/jetbrains-plugin/build/distributions/`.

## Development checks

```bash
gradle -p packages/jetbrains-plugin buildPlugin --no-daemon
cargo test -p versionlens-lsp
```

Run `bun run check` from the repository root before committing broad changes.
