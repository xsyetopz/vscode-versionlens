## How do I troubleshoot this extension?

- This plugin won't work unless you have `"editor.codeLens": true` enabled in your settings. (`true` is the default)

- Version lens uses editor action icons so make sure you don't have `"workbench.editor.editorActionsLocation": "hidden"` set

- Try resetting the cache by running the clear cache command (ctrl+p then type "Clear Cache") 
  This setting can be changed using `versionlens.caching.duration`. 

  You can try setting this value to `0` when doing tests 
  but recommended to keep around 3 minutes for normal usage.

- Version lens writes a log to an output channel in vscode.

  If you're experiencing issues then set your log level to `debug`.

  You can change the log level by either 
  - `ctrl+p` then type `Developer: Set Log Level`; or
  - via the `VersionLens` output log window

  > **NOTE**
  >
  > You may need to restart vscode if your issue is a start up problem.

  You can find the `VersionLens` output channel as seen in this picture:

- In the worst case no logs are output. There maybe an error in the developer tools of vscode. You can open the dev tools from the `help menu` in vscode
